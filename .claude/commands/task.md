# Zeno Framework Task Implementation

**First, review @CLAUDE.md to understand our project standards and workflow.**
Review the @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and @docs/REQUIREMENTS.md to understand what we are building.
We are working through @docs/PLAN.md and are on task $ARGUMENTS.

**Before implementing anything:**

1. Confirm you understand the current task requirements
2. Ask if you should reference any specific standards from `CLAUDE.md`
3. Only implement what's specified in this task

As you implement, explain:

- How the code works and why it meets our `REQUIREMENTS.md` requirements
- How it aligns with our `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Why it complies with our standards in `CLAUDE.md`

**After implementing:**

- Follow review process outlined in `CLAUDE.md`
- Mark the task as done in `PLAN.md`
- OPTIONAL: If your implementation touched other tasks or was unusual, update the task itself or other tasks as relevant
- OPTIONAL: If you learned new project standards or if you solved challenges that may help the next LLM instance, make a note of it in `CLAUDE.md`
- Commit the changes following our commit guidance
