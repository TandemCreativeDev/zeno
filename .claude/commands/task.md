# Zeno Framework Task Implementation

**First, review @CLAUDE.md to understand our project standards and workflow.**
Review the @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and @docs/REQUIREMENTS.md to understand what we are building.
We are working through @docs/PLAN.md and are on task $ARGUMENTS.

**Before implementing anything:**

1. Confirm you understand the current task requirements
2. Ask if you should reference any specific standards from `CLAUDE.md`
3. Only implement what's specified in this task

As you implement, explain:

- How the code works and why it meets our `REQUIREMENTS.md` requirements
- How it aligns with our `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Why it complies with our standards in `CLAUDE.md`

**After implementing:** Follow review process outlined in `CLAUDE.md`, fix issues if required. When there are no more errors, mark the task as done in `PLAN.md`. Then, commit the changes following our commit guidance.
