# Error Fix

**First, review @CLAUDE.md to understand our project standards and workflow.**
Review @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and @docs/REQUIREMENTS.md to understand what we are building.

We have recently completed task $TASK from @docs/PLAN.md, but we now need to fix a $ISSUE_TYPE issue in: `$FILE`, which may be related to previous tasks not necessarily the most recent.

**Error Context:**
- Current implementation status: Task $TASK completed
- Issue type: $ISSUE_TYPE (test/lint/build/type)
- Affected file: $FILE
- Additional context: $CONTEXT

**Before fixing:**
1. Analyse the specific error/issue
2. Identify root cause and compliance gaps with our standards
3. Determine minimal fix approach

**As you implement the fix:**
- Explain what was wrong and why
- Show how the fix aligns with standards in `CLAUDE.md`
- Ensure compliance with our TypeScript/testing conventions
- Verify the fix doesn't break other functionality

**After fixing:**
- Follow post-implementation process from `CLAUDE.md`
- Commit with descriptive message using British spelling
